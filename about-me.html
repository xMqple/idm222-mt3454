                    <h2> Story </h2>
                        <p> My name is Maple Tieu and I was born and raised in Philadelphia, PA. 
                            Being surrounded by technology at an early age, I developed a fascination with technology and the future of it. 
                            I am a student at Drexel and recently transferred into majoring in UXID.
                            I was originally a Computer Science major, but felt that it was too restricting and I was not to have the freedom to design. 
                            I still wanted to be able to code and have discovered UXID and thought that it was perfect for me. 
                            I am able to touch on my creative side as well as my technical skills.
                        </p>

                    <h2> Interests </h2>
                    <p> 
                        My interests are UI and UX design and trying to learn more of those techniques and understanding what makes a website easy to navigate or looks nice. 
                        I also am interested in coding and learning more about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to successfully design websites and applications. 
                        I occasionally play video games, some favorites of mine are Fire Emblem, pokemon, and Stardew Valley!
